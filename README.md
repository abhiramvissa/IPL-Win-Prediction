# IPL-Win-Prediction
It is IPL Win Prediction project which will predict the winner based on the user input 

🏏 IPL Win Prediction

This project predicts the outcome of IPL (Indian Premier League) matches using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze past match data, build predictive models, and provide insights into which team is likely to win based on match conditions.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning of IPL match dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for trends and insights.

Feature engineering (venue, toss, team strength, etc.).

Machine Learning models to predict match outcomes.

Model evaluation with accuracy metrics.

Interactive predictions for given match conditions.

📊 Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Decision Trees

(You can update this based on your notebook models)

🚀 Usage

Open the notebook and run all cells.

Modify input conditions (teams, venue, toss decision) to predict the winner.

📈 Results

Achieved an accuracy of XX% (update with your result).

Random Forest performed the best (example, update as per notebook).

🔮 Future Improvements

Use Deep Learning models (LSTM for time-series team performance).

Build a web app using Flask/Streamlit for live predictions.

Include player-level performance data for richer predictions.
